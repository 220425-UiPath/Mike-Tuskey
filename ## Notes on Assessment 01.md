## Git Basics 
- Git- A Version Control Sysytem that was created in 2005. Is basically terminal. It is a command line tool. A resposortiry that allows one work on project and work 
- GitHub is a web service and hosts the git respositories to easily collaborate with others. Source Control is Github
- Respitory is blank folder to drop your project 
- Local VCS- Error Prone 
- Centralize VCS- If the server is down you cant operate
- Distrbuted VCS- Git, BitBucket. This systems allows you to take from origin, clone it and then work on it to then push it forward.

## Git commands 
- Repository- workspace which tracks and manges files wihtin a folder. Every Git repo has its own history and not connected to other. 
- Git Status: It reports the status of the current repository. 
- git init: initializes a new repo whenever we are in the terminal and great directory called git. One repo per project 
- Commmitting- Most important git feature. It when you send your changes in your local machine and pushes it towards the GitHub
-Do a quick review of git committing and git commands

## Scripting Fundamentals
- Command Line- it is the coding program that is the place where one runs all git/shell commands. 
- Emulator- Allows the host system to emulate th equalities of a client system. A moblie application developer might run emulated device on their PC in order to test the application
- Shell- A computer program which a command line interpreter. Part of linear  A shell script includes operation to be performed like file manipulation, program execution and priting text. The utility that process your request

### Shell Commands 
1. echo- to output a string, display a line of text that is passed in as an argument. This is a bash command that is mostly used in shell scripts to output status to the screen or to a file. 
2. cat- commands means 'concatenate' and is used to view, create and append files. cat then follow through with what you want. 
3. grep- it is used to search text and strings in a given file 
4. mkdir- creates a new directory or folder
5. touch- creates a file
6. which- Which is a shell command that prints out the full path of an executable that is listed in the environment variable PATH. 
7. find- Find is a shell command to recursively search through a specified directory based on given parameters. Find is used to locate files that fit certain parameters without needing to manually search through a directory tree.
8. pwd- shows you are and prints the directory

### RPA 
# What is RPA?
- RPA stands for **R**obotic **P**rocess **A**utomation.
- It is a business process automation technology using bots to perform repetitive, high-volume tasks that are rule-based and trigger-driven.
    - The purpose of this technology is to accomplish several goals:
        - Reduce time spent on simple and repetitive tasks to streamline workflow, increase productivity, and reduce overhead.
        - Prevent errors caused by human involvment, reducing time spent making corrections and improving compliance.
        - Allow workforce to focus on more complex and meaningful tasks.

## The RPA Life Cycle
![RPA Life Cycle](https://www.blueprintsys.com/hs-fs/hubfs/RPA-Lifecycle-Management-Blueprint.png?width=500&name=RPA-Lifecycle-Management-Blueprint.png)
1. **RPA Candidate Identification**  
The first stage involves identifying business processes and tasks that are good candidates for automation.
2. **Assessment & Prioritization**  
This stage requires stakeholders to assess the processes and tasks from the previous stage based on technical feasibility and business value/ROI (Return On Investment). Candidates that pass this stage are then ordered by priority and passed to the next stage.
3. **Design**  
This stage is where solutions for automating candidate processes and tasks are defined and modeled. Any additional dependencies such as the RPA platform are also identified at this stage. A blueprint for the solution is created at the end of this stage to be presented to the development team.
4. **Development**  
In this stage, a development team builds the bot based on the blueprint from the design stage. The development is performed in the studio environment provided by the chosen RPA platform.
5. **Testing**  
At this stage, the development team or a separate QA/QC (quality assurance/quality control) team tests the bot in a test or sandbox environment to ensure it works as intended and to identify any possible edge cases missed throughout the previous two stages.
6. **Deployment**  
When the team(s) involved in the testing stage are satisfied that the solution is robust and stable enough, it is deployed into production.
7. **Monitoring & Change Management**  
As with all software development, the last stage involves monitoring the solution for errors and to ensure it meets any defined performance targets as well as maintaining the bot to ensure any external changes from any dependencies does not affect the bot's ability to perform its tasks.
## RPA Offerings

## Top RPA Vendors

1. **UiPath** 
-Offers a platform that gives anyone in an organization the ability to build and use robots. Developers with more experience can use a rich development environment with Studio, while citizen developers can automate simple, day-to-day tasks for themselves and their team with StudioX. UiPath also enables users to test any of their processes with the platform’s Test Suite. Additionally, the vendor offers a range of ways for staff to engage with bots through Action Center, UiPath Assistant, and Chatbots. Users can also create and manage governance policies with Automation Ops.

2. **Blue Prisim**
-Offers a diverse product portfolio, including intelligent automation, robotic operating models, Blue Prism Cloud, automation lifecycle management, and a process assessment tool, among other devices. Blue Prism’s intelligent automation platform is available for on-prem, public cloud, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments, as well as SaaS deployments.

3. **Automated Anywhere**
- Offers cloud-native and web-based automation platform that combines RPA, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and analytics.

### Visual Programming (Scratch)

- Scratch is a high-level block-based visual programming language and website aimed primarily at children as an educational tool for programming, with a target audience of ages 8 to 16.[6] Users on the site, called Scratchers, can create projects on the website using a block-like interface. Scratch allows one with limited coding skills to build programs 

### Variables, operators, conditionals, Iteration

- Variables- Each variable must belong to a data type. The data type determines th eamount of memmory spaced allocated to the varible. We can convert a variable from one data type to another. Intitializing variables means assigning values to varibales

### VB.NET
- VB.NET was developed by Microsoft and is a object-oriented language. The language is not case sensitivie and VB.NET programs run on .NET. 
- The language provides windows forms from which you can inheirt your own forms. Allows you to drag and drop feature when creating user interface.
